          <h3>Louis Longfellow</h3>
          <p>
            Louis Longfellow is a 9-year-old black and white Cardigan Corgi who loves to lay on his back and make snow angels in the winter. In the summer, he refuses to leave the beach and is an expert at fake swimming—walking in the water on his tippy toes as if he’s truly swimming. An avid paddleboarder, Louis is also a dedicated working dog tasked with keeping his brother Phinnaeus and Uncle Cooper away from anything suspicious within a 5-mile radius of the house.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louis loves belly rubs and being petted, but only by one person at a time. Don’t let his small size fool you—he keeps everyone in line. Louis enjoys playing fetch and will let YOU know when it’s time to stop. He finds enjoyment in setting up his brother to get in trouble and then watching him get yelled at. Additionally, Louis loves a good prank on the humans. This is Louis’s world, and we are all just guests.

          <h3>Phinnaeus Underfoot</h3>
          <p>
            Phinnaeus Underfoot is a lively and spirited 5-year-old Golden Retriever, known for greeting guests with his wagging tail and warm hugs. He loves to talk and can’t resist howling along with the fire whistle, always approaching everything with boundless energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phinnaeus often finds himself in trouble, thanks to his older brother Louis. His affectionate nature shines through as he adores cuddling and playfully holding hands. When Phinnaeus sets his sights on something, he becomes both sneaky and calculated, skillfully figuring out the best way to achieve his desires. Beyond his playful antics, Phinnaeus is a dedicated worker who loves spending time in the garden, picking peppers and digging holes.

          <h3>Uncle Cooper</h3>
          <p>
            Uncle Cooper is a 10-year-old Golden Retriever and the beloved uncle of our two hosts. Towering like a lion and seemingly made of Velcro, Cooper is the true leader of the pack, even while letting the boys believe they’re in charge. A gentle giant, Cooper loves to swim (though drying off takes days) and never goes anywhere without his favorite ball.
          </p>
          <p>Cooper is capable of drinking all the water in the Village of Colonie in one sitting and works hard to keep everyone warm with his heavy breathing. Known as the ‘Good Boy,’ Cooper uses his reputation to sneak extra food whenever possible. His tail could knock you over, but it never stops wagging. He doesn’t know his own strength, but his constant happiness more than makes up for it.</p>
